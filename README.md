# AI-based Customer Support Chatbot

This project presents a fine-tuned, conversational AI-based chatbot designed for customer support in the banking and finance domain. The model acts as a customer service chatbot for a fictional bank.  It uses the `Zephyr-7B-Beta` large language model with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning on custom instruction-response banking dataset.

## Features of this Chatbot

- Menu-based navigation for key banking service areas
- Free-text input support for real-world customer queries
- Context-aware responses (limited recent memory)
- Trained on a curated set of domain-specific FAQs and user queries compiled into a dataset
- Handles frustrated or emotionally charged inputs with empathy and answers dynamically
